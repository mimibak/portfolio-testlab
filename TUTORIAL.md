## Step 1

Let's change all steps in the checkbox with your information

- [ ] Replace the author name with your name in LICENSE
- [ ] Change the title in index.html to one of your choice
- [ ] Change the favicon in public folder and replace it with your Logo/Icon
- [ ] Change the copyright information
- [ ] Clean up the README.md file and remove unnecssary routes and replace it with your documentation
- [ ] ...

## Step 2

### We explain to you how we divided the sections and their elements.

1. Start with right click on the `index.html` and click `Open with Live Server`.  
   A new tab will open via your live server preview and you will find the website with `add`, `edit` and `delete` buttons for every section you want to change.

2. We want to `edit`the XY section and therefore we click on the `edit` button.  
   The component element to edit will open and you can replace the default text with your data and upload your profile picture.
   You can also `delete` the picture element, if you don't want to or have a picture of yourself ready.

3. More to come ...
