## About Portfolio Lab.

The reason why you don't have your own portfolio website is that you have no time? too lazy? too many side projects?  
We guess there is a lot of excuses why you don't have a digital portfolio online yet.  
Portfolio Labs goal is to give you an efficient way to do this with a basic framework and pre-built themes/designs.

Saved on your local machine and deployed by yourself. Absolute self-control and also individually customizable.
And the best thing about it? It's free! Really free and not just pseudo free.
Check out our live demo and start cloning the repo to reach your goal!

## History & current state

The project was born as a "flash idea" for us due to our internship at
Coding Bootcamps Europe. We call it the portfolio lab project.

It will be a personal challenge to plan, create and process this project for our application road. We considered this project to be a open-source project for the whole community as one of the first priorities, so everyone who struggles with the same issues like time, creativity or laziness can easily take our project and use it and apply to new job offers with it.

Enjoy yourself!
